# Rust API reference

podCI’s API reference is generated by `cargo doc` and published under the documentation site.

## Generate locally

From the repository root:

```bash
./scripts/gen_rustdoc_into_docs.sh
```

This writes rustdoc output to `docs/rustdoc/api/`.

## Open the docs

- In the published site: open **Rust API docs** in the navigation (this page).
- Locally (or published): open the generated rustdoc index: [`/rustdoc/api/index.html`](api/index.html).

!!! note
    In Zensical, navigation entries that don't resolve to Markdown are treated as raw URLs.
    That makes direct links like `rustdoc/api/index.html` easy to break (relative URL resolution
    depends on the current page). This page exists as a stable landing page.

!!! note
    If you generated rustdoc while `zensical serve` was already running, restart
    `zensical serve` so it picks up the newly-created `docs/rustdoc/api/` tree.
